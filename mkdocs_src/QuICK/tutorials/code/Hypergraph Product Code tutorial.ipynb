    "Hypergraph product (HGP) code is a family of CSS codes whose stabilizer generator matrix is obtained from a hypergraph product of two classical linear codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The construction of the $[[n,k,d]]$ CSS code is based on two binary linear seed codes, $\\mathcal{C}_i$ for $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$, each with parameters $[n_i,k_i,d_i]$. These are defined as the kernel of an $r_i \\times n_i$ check matrix $H_i$, where each matrix has a rank of $n_i - k_i$. The hypergraph product yields two classical codes $\\mathcal{C}_{X,Z}$ with parity-check matrices:\n",
